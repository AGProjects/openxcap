High priority
-------------

- Log server messages to syslog
- Add xcap-directory application
- Log the whole HTTP URI as sent by the client
- Validation after put/delete attribute

Low priority
------------

- Allow port in root= settings, thus making port= parameter unnecessary.
  Make sure that when listening on non-default port valid URIs are logged (see prev. issue)
  Inside, always use xcap root with port (if non-default), i.e. put port in logs, xcap-diff docs

- Test suite: validate after each GET, test well-formedness of the received elements.
- Finish global/users: test that all possible combinations (global/users GET/PUT/DELETE each app)
  return reasonable error
  - global + digest auth = not implemented
- URIs in att_value. Should differently encoded be considered equal?
  Note, that there're 2 encodings: percent-encoding, and xml attribute encoding (i.e. &quot; and friends)
  Resource Lists RFC features example document with http URI that has percent-encoding in it.
  Does that mean that to match against it, percents in the URI should be themselves percent-encoded?
  Or XCAP server should use its knowledge about the app and figure out that URIs are equivalent.
  This may be unreliable if it's unknown whether this URI was percent-encoded or not. Why
  that URI was percent encoded in the first place, why not paste it in the documents as it is, using
  XML escaping where necessary.
  Make few simple xpath expressions that include that URI as att_value and post it SIMPLE mailing list.
- Errors from twisted are text/html and from xcap are text/plain: use one (text/plain?)
