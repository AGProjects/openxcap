- Log the whole URI, not just path. construct it from Host headers or default
  xcap-root if Host is not present
- Allow port in root= settings, thus making port= parameter unnecessary.
  Make sure that when listening on non-default port valid URIs are logged (see prev. issue)
- finish global/users: test that all possible combinations (global/users GET/PUT/DELETE each app)
  return reasonable error
