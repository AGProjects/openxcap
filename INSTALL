Installation
------------

For Debian testing or unstable on an i386 architecture there is an official
public repository provided by AG Projects. To use it, add these lines in
/etc/apt/sources.list

# AG Projects software 
deb http://ag-projects.com/debian unstable main
deb-src http://ag-projects.com/debian unstable main

Install the AG Projects debian software signing key:

wget http://download.ag-projects.com/agp-debian-gpg.key apt-key add
agp-debian-gpg.key

After that, run:

apt-get update apt-get install openxcap

Following the same procedure you can install the xcap client and openser
integration packages using:

apt-get install python-xcaplib
apt-get install soap-simple-proxy
apt-get install openser-mi-proxy


For non Debian installations, you must perform the following steps to
install OpenXCAP:

 - Download the tarball from http://download.ag-projects.com.info/OpenXCAP/
 - Extract it using tar -xzvf openxcap-version.tar.gz and change directory
   to the newly created openxcap directory
 - Run python setup.py install as root.[[BR]]
 - Copy the config.ini.sample file to /etc/openxcap/config.ini and edit it as needed.
 - Copy the startup script, debian/openxcap.init to /etc/init.d/openxcap,
   and start the service: /etc/init.d/openxcap start

Prerequisites:

 - LibXML (http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
 - Python 2.5 or newer (www.python.org)
 - Twisted framework (http://twistedmatrix.com) - Twisted Core, Twisted Web and Twisted Web 2
 - python-lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml)
 - python-application
 - python-xml (_xmlplus package provided by pyxml library)
 - python-mysqldb

To enable TLS support:

 - GnuTLS library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls)
 - python-gnutls (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gnutls)

OepnXCAP has been tested on Debian unstable with the following versions:

 - libxml2: 2.6.32.dfsg-2
 - python: 2.5.2-1
 - python-application: 1.0.9-4
 - python-gnutls: 1.1.5-2
 - python-lxml: 2.0.5-1
 - python-sqlobject: 0.10.1-1
 - python-twisted-core: 8.0.1-1
 - python-twisted-web: 8.0.0-1
 - python-twisted-web2: 8.0.1-1
 - python-zopeinterface: 3.3.1-6


Testing with xcapclient
-----------------------

A command line client is available in the same download repository of
OpenXCAP server. The client can be used to manipulate full or partial XML
documents on XCAP servers (not limited to OpenXCAP) and has a bash shell
command line completion facility that makes it very easy to browse through
the structure of XML documents based on XPATH.

See README of python-xcaplib package for examples on how to create/retrieve
a document.
